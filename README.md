Simple binary database format. 

***_NOTE: It is strongly advised to NOT use the code that's directly inside the repo for production, as it sometimes may
change several times per day and the documentation may not fully match the actual code! There could even be incomplete, 
non-working code in the repo at any point which simply cannot run._***   
Use the latest release instead, as it is guaranteed to have matching documentation included and is guaranteed to run on 
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and thus also on most other Linux distros and on Window$/MacO$.
