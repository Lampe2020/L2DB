* Add from-drive working: only cache the valtable to memory, then read from the specified file the correct bytes via `file.seek(offset)` and then `file.read(length)`. For writing/deleting: cache the offset&length of the removed part, allocate it to a random temporary key, then append the new data at the end and mark the temporary key for deletion on cleanup. If the written data is shorter than previous, overwrite old data and allocate remaining offset&length to random key for cleanup deletion. If the written data is exactly as long as previous, just overwrite the old data. Maybe instead of temporary keys use seperate "this space is empty" markers, like on a file system.
